This project aimed to gain proficiency in setting up and managing game servers, enabling me to provide server hosting services to others while also facilitating private multiplayer game sessions for friends and family. The two gameservers that were created are for Assetto Corsa which is a very popular Racing game and Minecraft arguably one of the most popular games of all time.

In my existing VMs, I deployed a containerised Minecraft Spigot server using Docker, streamlining the setup process and facilitating effortless version control. Then I also decided to manually install my Assetto Corsa ACSM server which comes in with a built in dashboard that provided efficient user and mod management, enriching the Assetto Corsa experience for myself and fellow players.

The ACSM dashboard is a product made softwart that is purchased that allows users to self-host their servers and have more control on hardware performance, rather then paying a higher premium for a dedicated server. Therefore, this demanded a more hands-on approach. Adhering to best practices, I manually installed and configured the software on the virtual machine, tailoring it to the specific needs of the racing community. Automated startup scripts guaranteed server uptime while minimising maintenance requirements.

Beyond technical development, this project fostered a sense of community. Hosting these servers brought friends and family together, creating shared online experiences and fostering camaraderie. Through this journey, I not only enhanced my technical expertise but also honed my leadership and community-building skills.

This project ignited a passion for game server hosting. I envision expanding my skills to serve a wider range of games and communities, leveraging my knowledge of Docker, Proxmox, and Linux to create a reliable and accessible platform for gamers of all stripes.
