This module covered the material that is present in the CCNA 2 - Switching, Routing & Wireless Essentials (SRWE) & it allowed me to build up that knowledge of working with enterprise equipment such as layer 2 and layer 3 switches by particpating in the hands on labs, as well as building my own small business network utilising the hierarchical network design philosophy that consists of the Core, Distribution and Access layers. 


Here is a list of some of the main concepts that were covered in this module:
- C-based Applications Vulnerabilities
- Web Application Vulnerabilities
- Security Testing & Vulnerability Management
- Secure Software Design
- Attack Vectors
