Mathematics for Computing was the final module for semester 1. This module also expanded on the Mathematics module from my college degree, where we tackled more advanced and complex concepts that were in the context of computing. 

Here is a list of some of the main concepts that were covered in this module:
- Number Systems & Exponential Notation
- Vectors & Matrices
- Systems of Equations
- Statistics and Probabilities
- Combinatorics
- Introduction to Algorithms
