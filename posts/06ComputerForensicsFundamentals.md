This is the module where we learnt a lot about how computers could potentially leave incriminating evidence that could aid in forensic investigations. Concepts like hidden in plain sight, otherwise known as Steganography were very intriguing to discover. 

Here is a list of some of the main concepts that were covered in this module:
- Cryptography
- Steganography & Data Hiding
- Hashing
- File Headers & Signatures

Then there are special pieces of software that we used in this module such as:
- FTK Imager - Create images of forensic evidence
- FTK Registry - Examine regsistry files to determine data connected to programs, files and the OS.
- Oracle VirtualBox - A type 2 hypervisor that is used for sandboxing & installing OSs that are preloaded with forensics tools
