Access Control & Cryptography were the main focus of this module, as well as exams that focused on understanding the mathematical algorithms that a used behind the scenes in popular assymetric and symmetric algorithms like AES, DFH & RSA.

Here is a list of some of the main concepts that were covered in this module:
- Access Control
- Cryptography (Symmetric, Assymetric, Hashing)
- Cyber Attack Models
- Advanced FIrewalls (Heuristic, Signature & Anomaly) & Kerberos
- Risk Assessments
