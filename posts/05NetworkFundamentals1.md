This module covered the material that would appear in the CCNA1 -Introduction to Networks (ITN). In my opinion networks and networking is the hardest concept to grasp and learn, however I also enjoyed this module because of way we learnt how to use the network architecture and concepts of networks and how they operate. 

Here is a list of some of the main concepts that were covered in this module:
- Routing & Switching
- IPv4 & IPv6 Addressing
- The OSI & TCP/IP Model
- Network Topologies
- Intermediary & End Devices
- Building a Small Network
