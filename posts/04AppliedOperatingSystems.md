This was my favourite module of Year 1, I really enjoyed the way the module was structured and I loved the concept of Linux and deploying my own website in Wordpress. However the key takeaway was how to secure the system and try to lock it down by using different methods such as ssh keys, ssl certs, fail2ban & the concept of least privilege. Also another bonus to this module is that we used the Amazon Web Services aka AWS. We only did use the EC2 instances as using a lot more services that AWS at this stage would have been very tricky, however the great thing is there is a Cloud computing module in the final year that allowed me to pick up everything other then EC2 instances. It was a really enjoyable module but it was very difficult module to do and very time consuming but I managed to get it done and really was happy with what I achieved and I started to love using Linux and the act of deploying services and messing around with the Linux ecosystem. 

Here is a list of some of the main concepts that were covered in this module:
- Linux Operating System
- EC2 Instances and VPC in AWS
- Server Hardening
- Website Deployment (Wordpress)
